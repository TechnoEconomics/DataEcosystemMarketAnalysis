## Market analysis on data ecosystem initiators

This repository contains the datafile gathered, and used, in the research paper "A market analysis on data ecosystem initiators and their value propositions in different ecosystems". In this research a market exploration was performed, resulting in a dataset of a little over 100 organisations, companies, and initiatives that were considered initiators of data ecosystems. For more information on inclusion criteria for the dataset, working definitions on data ecosystems and accompanying concepts, and additional insights on this dataset, we like to refer you to the paper itself (current status: in preparation for submission).  

### Data fields
In this analysis we determined the current initiatorâ€™s maturity, the ecosystem scope in which they (or their customers) act, the main service that is offered by the initiator, and characterisation of the ecosystems they set up in terms of openness, data access and initiator goal.
