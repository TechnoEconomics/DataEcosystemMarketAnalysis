The thus developed TRUSTS platform, acting on its own but also as a platform federator covering different existing organisations in different jurisdictions, will investigate the legal and ethical aspects that apply on the entire data valorisation chain, from data providers to consumers, passing potentially via multiple platform operators, each of which may have different legal obligations.""";Deliverables available on https://www.trusts-data.eu/;"""Data sharing"""
